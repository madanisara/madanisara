# Sara Madani
Welcome! I am Sara, a master student enrolled in the MSc in Artificial Intelligence at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. I've recently graduated with a BSc in Mathematical and Computing Sciences for Artificial Intelligence at Bocconi University and during my bachelor studies I've attended a semester at Boston College as an exchange student. As my studies suggest, I'm really passionate about AI and its applications, including VR and design.

## Projects
### - SketchUp Models
The aim of these projects is to represent visually various models in a 3D environment, in order to resemble real and existing objects, thanks to the help of both AutoCAD and SketchUp. A particular focus has been given to famous elements of design (Ovalia chair, Rietveld chair, Makintosh chair and Krat Tafel), buildings (such as hotels) and other similar tasks (designing stairs).

### - Unity environments
Through Unity, a virtual reality game development software and engine, I designed some VR environments with specific interactive elements. Indeed, the goal was to develop models, taking care of both the visual/auditory aspect and the interactive one. The main projects consist in designing a garage and a park, both supervised by an online course provided by the University of London.

### - Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Programming (Python)
During my bachelor I had the opportunity to develop multiple Machine Learning-driven python codes, individually and as a team with other students. These varied both in means and goals, meaning that not only the techniques used are quite different but the application areas vary as well.

#### 1) ML for predicting specific variables [https://github.com/madanisara/ml-multiclass-classification]

#### 2) AI Lab Project: ML for Health [https://github.com/madanisara/ml-for-health]

#### 3) Code Companion: Using ML to Detect Vulnerabilities in Code

#### 4) AI & ML applied to the education field - Bachelor Thesis Project
