## Sara Madani
I am a master student enrolled in the MSc in Artificial Intelligence at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. I've recently graduated with a BSc in Mathematical and Computing Sciences for Artificial Intelligence at Bocconi University and during my bachelor studies I've attended a semester at Boston College as an exchange student. As my studies suggest, I'm really passionate about AI and its applications, including VR and design.
